                    <p> WITH BUYER</br>
                        Buying an item online, especially a used one, can sometimes be risky. The following are some small notes you should take a look at to ensure more safety when shopping online.</br>
                        1. Be careful with sellers without an address, without a clear phone number.</br>
                        2. Be very careful with offers much cheaper than the market.</br>
                        3. Before sending money, you need to: Find information online, ask others to know exactly about the item, its accessories, come to see the item in person, try all the features, time and conditions warranty conditions, time and conditions for returning the machine... and think carefully before deciding.</br>
                        4.Do not hand over money before receiving the goods, especially with new and unknown sellers.</br>
                        5. When you want to buy a certain item, it is best to use the phone to contact to buy immediately, do not PM (create a conversation) or PM the seller to PM me, call me.</br>
                        6. With high-value items, you should choose to buy at stores, merchants or members who have clear brands and addresses.</br>
                        7. Do not let the seller bring the goods to you to see when you are not clear about the item. Because the buyer can cancel the purchase and really annoy the seller.</br>
                    </p>
                    <p> WITH SELLER</br>
                        1.It is recommended to post only one item in a post so that buyers can easily view, search and compare prices.</br>
                        2. Clear, serious title. The price is correct, the condition listed is true to the actual condition of the product for sale.</br>
                        3. Update full address and phone number. Phone numbers should be entered and authenticated through Antique World's system, should not be posted in the content of the article so that phone number information is secure.</br>
                        4. The sale post should have real product photos. Describe the product condition in as much detail as possible.</br>
                        5.Buyers should see the item carefully before accepting their money.</br>
                        6. Do not bring the device to the buyer because they may not buy after seeing the device for many different reasons.</br>
                        7. It is better to build yourself a long-term brand than to take advantage of the short term.</br>
                        Best regards . !!</br>

                    <p>To ensure fairness</br>
                        Avoid the scam of hanging goats selling dog meat (receiving goods not as shown in the picture, not as agreed).</br>
                        The buyer sends money and the seller doesn't send the goods (so the buyer loses money).</br>
                        The buyer asks to send the goods and then the seller sends it to the place, but the buyer does not buy or receive the goods (and the courier has to return it to the seller, so the seller costs 2 ends of the cost)</br>
                    </p>
                    <p>CASE:â€‹</br>
                        After BKC receives the goods and checks them, if they do not meet the requirements, they will not receive them.</br>
                        100% refund of the purchase price for the person who needs to buy.</br>
                        If the goods are lost or damaged due to BKC's subjective fault, we will refund the purchase price or negotiate compensation.</br>
                        Time for goods and money to reach customers is 3-7 working days, counting from the time BKC receives money to buy for them.</br>
                        If the case is late than expected, we will contact the customer in advance, hope customers understand.</br>
                        BKC is not responsible for indirect damages caused by loss of delivery (that is the responsibility of other courier departments, we will work together with them) or damages due to delayed delivery. delay caused or for risks caused by force majeure (such as natural disasters, earthquakes, storms, floods, wars, riots, plane crashes; natural nature of goods; damage caused by electricity or magnetically erases images, data or sounds, etc.).</br>
                        The maximum delivery time is 05 times in 15 days (from the first notice) by phone or email. If you do not contact to receive the goods, BKC has the right not to refund the purchase and not to send the goods.</br>
